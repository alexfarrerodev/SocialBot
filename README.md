# **SocialBot**

SocialBot is an automated tool designed to interact with specific images on your screen. It clicks on certain images (`photo1` most frequently, and `photo2` less often for actions like page changes), activates page scrolling when necessary, and allows you to stop or modify its behavior using keyboard shortcuts.

## **Features**
- **Automatic Click Detection:** The bot detects predefined images (`photo1` and `photo2`) on your screen and clicks them accordingly.
- **Page Scrolling:** The bot can automatically scroll down a page when needed.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Easily control the bot’s actions with keyboard shortcuts.
  
## **CONTROLS**
- **Activate detection + click mode:** `ctrl + 1`
- **Deactivate detection + click mode:** `ctrl + 2`
- **Activate page scroll down:** Press `+` for two seconds
- **Deactivate page scroll down:** Press `-` for two seconds
- **Close the program:** `ctrl + 0` (hold and spam)

## **How to Use**
1. Download the executable or run the program using `run.bat`.
2. If you see a terminal window open without any output, this means the bot is currently running in the background and actively scanning the screen for the specified images.
3. Use the keyboard shortcuts to control the bot’s behavior as described in the **CONTROLS** section.

### **Important Notes**
- **photo1** is the image that the bot clicks most often. Ensure this image represents the action you want to perform frequently (e.g., clicking a button or confirming an action).
- **photo2** is used for less frequent actions, such as navigating between pages.
  
If the terminal remains open without showing anything, don’t worry! This indicates that the bot is actively running and awaiting the appropriate conditions to trigger its actions.
